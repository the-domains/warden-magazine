            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Anchoress Soars</h1><p>Drops of rain gather on the sill—peasants on a feast day—then tumble down the wall. The rivulets are like things of long ago, the tall Scots pines at the river. Mamm used to scrub our clothes and the maidens’ ribbons at Beltane festival there. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/00b43eee-fe12-4e08-b2c2-cf24fd9adbbc.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Leaves]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Leaves</h1><p>Leaves laze across the sidewalk, cascaded by the breeze—a motherly breeze. A man behind a pane of glass brings a cup to his mouth. He shuts his eyes, then keeps them shut, inhaling the scent of dirty, rich coffee. The smell is so physical it rips through his nose and bites the back of his tongue. It tastes bitter, dense, makes him clench. He opens his eyes, looks up, sees the leaves pirouette as the wind tosses them over. The girl at the next table looks at him, he can feel it, her gaze. His exhale quivers. He rubs his face with large hands—overly large hands, hands that make the cup look like a Grande when it’s really a Venti, hands so big he knows they’re why the girl is looking at him, why everyone looks at him, his one great flaw—gets up and leaves.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0ac7dfaa8ff326def474348fae84d75c4cfe0b2d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bright Red Bronco</h1><p>The boy and his girl drove through the wind in a bright red Bronco. Its big, tall tires glided over the earth and down that long, quiet highway. The evening sun was waving good bye when just then the boy noticed something on the next hill. He sat up in his seat and turned his hat around, squinting behind his sunglasses. A smile smoothed over his face as he realized what it was. One hand slid off the steering wheel to point it out to his girl but she was staring at her phone.</p></article>]]></description>
