# Bright Red Bronco

The boy and his girl drove through the wind in a bright red Bronco. Its big, tall tires glided over the earth and down that long, quiet highway. The evening sun was waving good bye when just then the boy noticed something on the next hill. He sat up in his seat and turned his hat around, squinting behind his sunglasses. A smile smoothed over his face as he realized what it was. One hand slid off the steering wheel to point it out to his girl but she was staring at her phone.
