Drops of rain gather on the sill---peasants on a feast day---then tumble down the wall. The rivulets are like things of long ago, the tall Scots pines at the river. Mamm used to scrub our clothes and the maidens' ribbons at Beltane festival there. 

I watch the trickle find the ground then trace its way along the wall towards the shadow in the corner. Slowly, a faint aroma, faint but rich and earthy, mingles with the familiar dank of stone and clay. Perhaps tomorrow, before the bread and wine, the clouds will tire of our burgh and allow the sun to illume the greenness of that clump of moss.

Two years now I have spent behind these walls---these soldiers of my soul. They bind my body to this square of dirt, away from the plague of gluttony, the temptation of the minstrel's song, and the lesser loves of ploughmen and bairns. I refuse to be this world's chattle, harnessed to it like a ploughing ox. No, I will soar, like the goshawks in the sky beyond my window.

The rain has stopped. I plump the hay beneath me and listen as the thatched roof sheds its last drops. I close my eyes and wonder...did his blood, as it fell from his beard, sound like drips of rain?

I decide that tomorrow, when I take the host and the wine, I will remember the sound of his blood. That blood...so red, so sharp on the tongue, so warm in the throat.
