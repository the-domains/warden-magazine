Dear Christopher,

My forehead tightens writing this to you. I must make it personal. Many and various are the words you've written and said about God, and, while you might find this irritating, I have prayed to him about you. Now, I know what you think of prayer---I've read your books, your essays, your letters, especially _Mortality_.

In one of your essays you quoted Ambrose Bierce's definition of prayer from _The Devil's Dictionary_: "Prayer: A petition that the laws of nature be suspended in favor of the petitioner, himself confessedly unworthy," commenting that

> Everybody can see the joke that is lodged within this entry: The man who prays is the one who thinks that god has arranged matters all wrong, but who also thinks that he can instruct god how to put them right. Half-buried in the contradiction is the distressing idea that nobody is in charge, or nobody with any moral authority. The call to prayer is self-cancelling.

You are right about that, you know. This paradox is unsettling. Faith itself is unsettling. We are small, limited "primates," as you say, who have no business in divine affairs. Christians are themselves a paradox. In one sense they believe Jesus Christ has forgiven them their sin and justified them before God as perfect, holy, and righteous, who are called children of the Father, able to come to him with their requests. They are cared for more than sparrows and lilies of the field. They are the pinnacle of creation.

It is Christianity that inspired our species' greatest architecture, poetry, and paintings. Who would Shakespeare be without Christianity? Or Milton or Michelangelo? Would we have been able to see Bernini's statues or Rodin's sculptures? Would you have heard Evensong beneath the spires of Oxford? In fact, would you have even been able to study at Oxford if it weren't for Christianity? That great university, and every other major university in the world, was founded to teach people the faith.

Yet in another sense Christians, and every other human, are desperately fallen creatures whose souls bend toward their own selfish desires. They are often impatient, unkind, and bitter monsters. The world watches their culture wars and their wicked words, all in the name of God. Bible verses have been used to justify murder and slavery. The church has committed indecent acts, grotesque acts which you are right to condemn. Christians indeed are those you hate---Mother Teresa, Billy Graham, Jerry Falwell---but Christians are also your friends---Francis Collins, Douglas Wilson, Larry Taunton. Some have ended lives while others have ended slavery. 

But your life, Christopher, is coming to an end. At the close of business, the eternal footman will hold your coat and snicker. Like your dear friend Kingsley Amis once wrote,

> Death has this much to be said for it:  
> You don't have to get out of bed for it.  
> Wherever you happen to be  
> They bring it to you---free.

As you lay dying, and until this "blind, emotionless alien" destroys your body, until it's hello darkness my old friend, permit me to write a few words to you. Allow me to give you new spectacles. What you have written against all these years is in fact not Christianity at all, and, if I might say so, the thing you have been banging on about is actually the life of a Christian. Our beloved Oscar Wilde put it like this in "The Ballad of Reading Gaol."

> Yet each man kills the thing he loves  
> By each let this be heard,  
> Some do it with a bitter look,  
> Some with a flattering word,  
> The coward does it with a kiss,  
> The brave man with a sword!

You have been a brave man, but you killed with flattering words the very thing you loved---truth, beauty, and goodness. You were after these things. You wanted justice for your mother's suicide, justice for the tyrants and bullies, justice for the so-called Christians who oppress others in the name of God. You wanted freedom. You wanted friendship. You wanted love. These are offered in Christ, in Christianity. They are only possible in the person of Jesus Christ. In him we see truth and beauty and goodness. In him is justice, freedom, friendship, and love.

Of course, I won't patronize you by pretending or presuming to know what the Christian life is supposed to be in any detail. I don't know so much, and it looks different for different people. But I will tell you some themes in the Christian life, primarily by presenting to you the gospel.

The paradoxes of life---the ugliness and beauty of the world---are presented in Christianity. While we don't have answers for all these things, we do have acknowledgement. We do have hope. So, let me start there.

In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, but surely you are familiar with this story, having heard them as a small boy in the Anglican church. (When, you might ask, did the Almighty whip this together? Was it thirteen billion years ago? Four and a half billion? Six thousand? But we haven't got time for that.) God created man in his image. This means we have a capacity to feel empathy, to see beauty, to create and build, to be jealous and desirous. Desire swelled in Eve to do the one thing God told our grandparents not to do---eat the fruit from the forbidden tree. Convinced by the serpent, Eve took and ate the fruit, "whose mortal taste brought death into the world and all our woe."

So, from the beginning sin has been destroying the world. Here lies the provenance of war, murder, envy, hurricanes, miscommunication, and the bruising of bananas. Creation is given to decay. We are rotting. From the moment we are born we begin to die. The whole creation is dying. Even more than that, it knows it. It's crying out like the pains of childbirth.

You see, this is why you long for truth, beauty, and goodness. This is why you want justice. You were created for it, but you recognize that all is not right with the world. Something has happened. This recognition is a recognition of sin. You know what sin is, and you know this is not how it's supposed to be. That longing for things to be right and good and beautiful proves that you are created in God's image, and that you are living in his universe. You and everyone else has an inward desire for God, but we can't reach him because of this sin.

God, therefore, became a man. He reached out to us. Christianity is in this way a received faith. It is given to us. In the man Jesus of Nazareth, "all the fullness of the Deity dwells bodily." This Jesus lived the life of a human, just like us---with food, farts, and friends. The Bible goes even farther to say that Jesus was tempted in every way as we are but remained without sin.

This last paragraph was important. Jesus must have been fully God for a few reasons. First, the Bible says so. Second, his being fully God means that he is the only proper sacrifice for sin, since it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sin. His being deity also means he could satisfy the infinite wrath of God the Father, what Christians call propitiation. Jesus must also have been fully man for a few similar reasons. His being fully human means he could properly stand in our place to receive the penalty for sin---death. Of course, he didn't remain that way.

What did his death accomplish? His death satisfied the wrath of God, but he was raised on the third day by the glory of the Father to conquer death, that we, too, might become the righteousness of God. This is what Christians mean by eternal life, that we might know and be accepted by God.

In simple terms, the gospel is the message that Christ died for our sins and rose again from the dead, according to the scriptures.

So then, how do you obtain this eternal life? In the gospels we see John the Baptist preaching, "Repent and believe in the gospel." Jesus, too, preached this message. Peter and Paul preached this message in Acts. Paul explained it again in his letter to the Romans. My point is that in order to have this life you must turn away from your sin and accept Christ, what he has done for you and what he will continue to do for you. We simply trust that God has forgiven us in Christ. This is faith. We have faith that God loves us, and has sent his son to die in our place and rise again so that we might have life.

Now, of course, I would be lying to you if I said I did not doubt or have difficulty with this faith. I do, often fitfully so. One famous theologian said that you do not have to be a theologian to be a Christian, but he probably did. "Being a Christian has not and does not come naturally or easy for me." He goes on to say that becoming a Christian is a lifelong process, a difficult process, but one that becomes an increasingly beautiful thing.

This is certainly the case. Doubt, lament, contention---these are all aspects of a faithful Christian. I have often wondered the same things you have. I, too, have similar observations, frustrations, and questions. That isn't unusual in the least. All throughout the psalms, for example, the psalmists hurl their questions toward heaven. The prophets have breakdowns, despairing and weeping over God's people.

So, what does the Christian life look like? This I cannot tell you. I can only say that it is a long and narrow hallway filled with a thousand doors. It is a beautiful hallway, but sometimes the lights go out and you have to stumble around in the darkness for a bit. Monsters appear in a doorway from time to time. But then, just when you need it, a light flickers and beams long enough for you to escape and continue. The wallpaper becomes immeasurably brighter and lovelier with each step, and then it goes dark again.
This letter to you is only the door into the hallway. Walking down the hallway itself will take much more correspondence, correspondence which I hope we continue. You once wrote, "If there is anybody known to you who might benefit from a letter or a visit, do not on any account postpone the writing or the making of it. The difference made will almost certainly be more than you have calculated." I hope this is one of those occasions.
Christopher, I hope that you benefit from this letter. Suppose you do consider what I've written here, the difference made will be worth a thousand lifetimes. I hope that you see what life could become, and I wish I could explain it to you as eloquently as you explain things.
Though you might not like the idea of prayer, and you certainly don't like the idea of God or Christianity---what you call "celestial North Korea"---I will continue to pray for you. Your day is drawing to a close, but there is a way to pass through to the other side.
I hope you write soon, and that you find the door.
Mortally yours,
Brandon
